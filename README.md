# TECHGAFIL
Business website. The main goal was to create a minimalist site that: : informs about what the company produces, shows products, had a contact form, is multilingual, has a simple design.

This is my first site used in the real world, created with a different technology than WordPress.

Key features:

      1. Working contact form without CAPTCHA (but not filling up the inbox with SPAM).
      2. Product gallery.
      3. Multilingual.
      4. Handle cookies acceptance.

Site made from scratch by me.
